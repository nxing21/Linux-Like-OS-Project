    - Had a bug where running the OS would boot-loop.
    - Fixed by commenting out 'launch tests()' from kernel.c and implementing gdt.
    - Took about 7 hours.

Oct 14th, 2023:
    - Fixed an issue with implementing the PIC
    - The OS would crash and close out every time the PIC was initialized
    - Fixed by sending 0xFF to the data port of the PIC at the end of initializing the PIC.
    - Took about 5 hours to solve.

Oct 15th, 2023:
    - Incorrect addresses after running 'info mem'.
    - Fixed by correcting video memory from being a page table to being a page.
    - Took about 4 hours.

Oct 15th, 2023:
    - Ran into an issue where the OS would be continually boot looping after implementing paging
    - Fixed by changing the page table's base addresses from 'i * ALIGN' to 'i'.
    - Took about 4 hours.

    - Ran into some issues while implementing the CAPS lock.
    - At first, the CAPS lock press and release was not registering.
        - The issue was that the mapping was wrong. Fixed the scan code mapping.
    - Weird characters appeared after turning on and typing in CAPS lock  
        - Fixed the issue by setting a conditional that would not map scan codes that 
        was greater than SCAN_CODE_MAP_DATA (59)
    - Issue where the user could not leave the CAPS LOCK
        - Fixed the issue by changing some of the logic in my conditionals.
Overall, all of these issues took around an hour to debug.

Oct 16th, 2023:
    - Ran into some some miscallenous issues where random keys would not register
    or would not type the right key.
    - Fixed this issue by changing the mapping data according to the scan keys and the 
    ASCII table.
Overall, this issue took about 15 minutes to debug.

Oct 16th, 2023:
    - Ran into an issue when trying to implement CAPS lock and shift at the same time.
    - The CAPS & Shift case would act the same as no special keys activated.
    - Fixed this issue by changing some of the if logic behind implementing CAPS lock
    and Shift. 

Oct 20th, 2023:
    - Ran into issue with file system, where program page faults after trying to access
    the starting data block address.
    - Found by adding print statements throughout the read_data function, and seeing
    where is the last print statement reached.
    - Fixed by editing one variable that was incorrect (used inode length instead
    of number of inodes).
    - Took about 30 minutes to fix.
